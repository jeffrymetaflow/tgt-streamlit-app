st.sidebar.markdown("""
**Temporal Gravity Theory (TGT)** is a framework for understanding how we distribute our attention and emotional energy across time: the past, present, and future.

- **Past Gravity**: Memory, nostalgia, trauma, reflection  
- **Present Gravity**: Sensory awareness, mindfulness, flow  
- **Future Gravity**: Ambition, imagination, worry, planning  

TGT helps identify where your mental energy tends to gravitate‚Äîyour **Temporal Focus Ratio (TFR)**‚Äîand offers insights to rebalance.

**Goal:** Achieve *Temporal Integration*, where attention is fluid and balanced across time zones.

### Archetypes:
- üï∞Ô∏è **The Reflector** ‚Äì Past-dominant
- üåø **The Practitioner** ‚Äì Present-centered
- üöÄ **The Visionary** ‚Äì Future-driven
- üîÑ **The Integrator** ‚Äì Balanced and adaptable

The 15-question assessment measures your focus and plots it into this temporal model to offer clarity and action steps.
